CSCI 2040U - Software Design and Analysis

Project Lab 2 - Rapid Prototyping

Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lab, students will have demonstrated the following outcomes:

Design and implement a high-level, functional prototype within a constrained timeframe. Utilize basic software design principles to create modular code that integrates a front end, back end, and database. Understand and apply the concept of rapid prototyping for validating ideas before delving into detailed requirements. Collaborate effectively in teams, dividing tasks and managing time to achieve a shared goal. System Description

You have been tasked with rapidly prototyping a catalog management system. The system will allow users to manage a list of items stored in a database. While the exact domain of the catalog (e.g., books, tools, or products) is unknown, the prototype must include the following general functionalities:

Database Interaction: Read an initial dataset from a simple database (such as a text or CSV file). Save updates back to this database. Front-End Interface: Display a list of catalog items. Allow users to view, add, and edit items. Back-End Logic: Validate user inputs for adding or editing items. Handle the interaction between the database and the front-end interface. The goal is to create a functional prototype demonstrating these core features, with the potential to expand or refine it in future iterations.

Expectations of This Lab

Phase 1: Planning (10 minutes) Team Roles: Confirm roles based on team strengths (e.g., front end, back end, database manager, integrator, tester). System Overview: Brainstorm and sketch the prototype's architecture. Decide how data will flow between components: Database (text/CSV file): Source of data. Back end: Logic for reading, editing, validating, and saving data. Front end: Displays the catalog and enables user interaction (command-line menus are acceptable). Phase 2: Prototyping (60 minutes) Milestone 1 (10 minutes): Database Integration

Create a flat file (e.g., CSV or text) containing sample catalog data (e.g., ID, Name, Description). Write a script to read data from this file and parse it into a usable format (e.g., a list of dictionaries or JSON objects). Milestone 2 (15 minutes): Front-End Interaction

Implement a basic CLI or menu system to display catalog items read from the database. Allow users to select an item to view details. Milestone 3 (20 minutes): Adding Core Functionality

Add back-end functionality to: Edit existing items (e.g., update fields like name or description). Add new items (prompt user for inputs, validate them). Validate inputs (e.g., check for non-empty fields). Milestone 4 (10 minutes): Saving Changes

Write logic to save any updates back to the original database file. Ensure all changes are reflected when the program is re-run. Stretch Goal (Optional): User Login (5 minutes)

Add a basic login system where users must enter a username and password (hard-coded or from a file). Phase 3: Demo and Wrap-Up (10 minutes) Teams present a short demo of their prototype to the TA. Highlight the ability to view, edit, add, and save items. Show the code structure.

Tips, Tricks, and Resources

Tips Focus on the Core: Start with basic functionality (read, display, edit, add, save). Expand only if time allows. Define Clear Interfaces: Agree on how each component will interact before implementation to avoid integration issues. Break It Down: Divide the work into manageable tasks and set micro-deadlines. Test Incrementally: Verify each component works before integrating it with others. Tricks Use a simple text or CSV format for the database to avoid complexity. Modularize your code: keep database logic, back-end processing, and front-end interaction separate. For validation, enforce simple rules, such as requiring fields to be non-empty or numeric where appropriate. General Resources Flat File Formats: Text or CSV files are easy to manage and read/write programmatically. Prototyping Strategy: Prioritize the "happy path" (normal, error-free user flow) first; handle edge cases later. Time Management: Allocate time per task and stick to it. If a task overruns, simplify the approach. Division of Labor: Assign each team member a dedicated responsibility but encourage constant communication to ensure smooth integration.
